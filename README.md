#  Power BI Learning Journey  

This repository contains my learnings and practice tasks from exploring **Microsoft Power BI**.  
Below are the key takeaways from each task I completed:  

---

##  Task 1: Navigate the Power BI Interface and Import Data  
- Power BI supports countless ways to import data (API, Web, Excel, CSV, etc.).  
- It can automatically detect tables from your Excel workbook.  

---

##  Task 2: Transform Data Using Power Query  
- You can edit and transform data after importing it using **Power Query**.  
- Transformations also apply to **new incoming data** automatically.  
- Power BI can detect **primary key–foreign key relationships** and build them for you.  
- If needed, you can still manually edit relationships in **Model View**.  

---

##  Task 3: Insert and Format a Visualization  
- Power BI provides a wide array of **native visualizations** for presenting data.  
- When dealing with dates, you can easily adjust the **granularity** (Year, Quarter, Month, Day) without transformations.  
- Visuals are fully customizable (text color, background, labels, etc.).  

---

##  Task 4: Add More Visuals to Enhance Storytelling  
- No single graph fits all data:  
  - **Cards** → Single values  
  - **Tables** → Lists of items  
  - **Line Charts** → Variations over time  
- Clicking on a field in a visual will **filter the entire report view** to related data.  

---

##  Task 5: Publish the Report to the Power BI Workspace  
- Before sharing, always:  
  - Apply a **theme**  
  - Add a **descriptive title**  
- Once published to **Power BI Service**, there are many sharing options (requires a Microsoft account).  

---

###  Next Steps  
- Continue experimenting with **advanced DAX formulas**  
- Explore **Power BI Service features** like scheduled refresh, security roles, and sharing permissions  
- Practice building **end-to-end dashboards** for real datasets
